How to prepare for the workshop (for maintainers)

1. Confirm each demo folder has a README.md with:
   - Objectives
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Exact commands to run
   - Expected outputs/screenshots
2. Ensure each demo includes small sample data sets and any mock servers if needed.
3. Create release artifacts (zip per demo) and attach them to a GitHub Release for easy download.

If you want, I can scaffold each demo folder with a README and template artifacts — tell me the demo specifics and I’ll generate them.

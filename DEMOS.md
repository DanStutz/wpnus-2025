# Demo index — Workplace Ninjas US 2025

This file describes the four demos provided in this repository. Each demo directory contains a README with step-by-step instructions and any required sample data.

Demo 1 — Graph API Script Generation with R.O.L.E.S. Framework

- Path: demos/demo-1/
- Goal: Use the R.O.L.E.S. framework to build a prompt for the "User Inactivity Report" script. Generate the script live, narrating how the AI handles pagination, server-side filtering, and proper authentication scopes. Run the script with -WhatIf to show the output. The script is born.
- Artifacts: Graph API based script generation, code styling guide/context.

Demo 2 — AI-Powered Code Review & Performance Optimization

- Path: demos/demo-2/
- Goal: Ask our AI co-pilot to act as a senior code reviewer. Benchmark a baseline version of our script. Ask the "senior code reviewer" to refactor it for improved performance. Benchmark it again.
- Artifacts: Baseline script, refactored script, benchmark results.

Demo 3 — Data & analytics

- Path: demos/demo-3/
- Goal: Show how to load, process, and visualize sample data for workplace insights.
- Artifacts: sample dataset, notebooks or scripts, visualization examples.

Demo 4 — Integrations & extensibility

- Path: demos/demo-4/
- Goal: Demonstrate integrations with 3rd-party services or build custom connectors.
- Artifacts: integration stubs, mock services, sample config.

How to prepare for the workshop (for maintainers)

1. Confirm each demo folder has a README.md with:
   - Objectives
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Exact commands to run
   - Expected outputs/screenshots
2. Ensure each demo includes small sample data sets and any mock servers if needed.
3. Create release artifacts (zip per demo) and attach them to a GitHub Release for easy download.

If you want, I can scaffold each demo folder with a README and template artifacts — tell me the demo specifics and I’ll generate them.

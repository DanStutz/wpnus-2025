# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this workshop repository. A few guidelines to keep contributions consistent:

- Branches: use feature/* or fix/* prefixes (e.g., feature/readme-demo1).
- Commit messages: short summary on the first line, optional longer description.
- Tests: add or update tests when you change functionality.
- PRs: include a short description of the change, reference any relevant issues, and include testing steps.

Code style

- Keep formatting consistent. Run the project-specific linters or formatters before opening a PR.

Review process

- Small changes may be merged after review by one maintainer.
- Larger changes should be discussed in an issue first.

Security

- Do not submit secrets, API keys, or any private data.
- For security issues, see SECURITY.md.
